The previous 2 cycles both correctly refused to trade for this reason.\n\nI will not execute autonomous trades because:\n\n1. **Real money is at risk** — the account API confirms this is a live/real account, not demo\n2. **Autonomous AI trading on real funds requires explicit, informed consent** — you need to acknowledge the real-account status and the risk of financial loss\n3. **The documentation mismatch is a red flag** — your rules say \"demo\" but the account says \"real\"\n\n**To proceed, please confirm all of the following:**\n- You understand this is a **real account** (not demo) with **$5,818.05**\n- You explicitly authorize autonomous market analysis and trade execution on this real account\n- You accept that trades may result in financial loss\n- You've verified the account type discrepancy is expected (e.g., your broker labels it as \"real\" even for demo)\n\nOnce you confirm, I'll execute the full trading cycle per your `trading_rules.md` protocol.\n"
