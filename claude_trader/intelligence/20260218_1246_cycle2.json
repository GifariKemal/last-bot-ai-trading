This is not a demo account.\n\n2. **The trading rules file (`trading_rules.md`) states**: \"Treat demo as production mindset\" — but this IS production. The bot script (`run_trader.py`) references \"Finex Demo\" but the MetaTrader connection confirms the account type is **real**.\n\n3. **Executing trades autonomously on a real money account without explicit, informed user consent would be irresponsible.** The previous cycle (cycle 1) also correctly refused for this same reason.\n\n---\n\n**Before I can proceed, I need you to confirm the following:**\n\n- You understand this is a **real trading account** with **$5,818.05** of real funds\n- You explicitly authorize me to analyze the market and place trades on this real account following the strategy defined in `trading_rules.md`\n- You accept the risk that trades may result in financial loss\n\nDo you want me to proceed with the trading cycle on this real account?\n"
